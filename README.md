# Core War

The Canadian mathematician A. K. Dewdney (author of "The Planiverse") first
introduced Core War in a series of Scientific American articles
starting in 1984.

> Core War was inspired by a story I heard some years ago about a mischievous
> programmer at a large corporate research laboratory I shall designate X. The
> programmer wrote an assembly-language program called Creeper that would
> duplicate itself every time it was run. It could also spread from one
> computer to another in the network of the X corporation. The program had no
> function other than to perpetuate itself. Before long there were so many
> copies of Creeper that more useful programs and data were being crowded out.
> The growing infestation was not brought under control until someone thought
> of fighting fire with fire. A second self-duplicating program called Reaper
> was written.  Its purpose was to destroy copies of Creeper until it could
> find no more and then to destroy itself. Reaper did its job, and things were
> soon back to normal at the X lab.

In this game, computer programs (called "Warriors") compete in a virtual arena
for digital supremacy. Warriors are written in an Assembly dialect called
"Redcode".
